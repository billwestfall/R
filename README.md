# R

taking a stab at R for some statistics problems

including problems from Finite Mathematics and Calculus with Applications by Lial, Greenwell and Ritchey

for a Mac M1 you may need to run R interactively (or call it using full path programatically) like

```
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/R
```
